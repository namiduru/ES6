WebPack is module bundler
----------------------------

Just like browserify
  but has more features like bundling
    images, css files ...

As a example project
  Here are two folders which are dist and src

For installing webpack globally from node package manager
  - npm install webpack -g
  - npm instal webpack-dev-server
For configuring webpack you need to create webpack.config.js  
Use webpack --watch for watching changes in code

Some browser does not compatible with ES2015(ES6)
  So you need to transpile them into the ES5 with babel
  - npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015

For saving saving your dependancy you need to indentify them in package.json
  npm init for creating package.json
